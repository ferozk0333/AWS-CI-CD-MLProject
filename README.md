## End to End Machine Learning Project - Regression

Description: An end-to-end regression solution implemented using a modular programming approach. The model (with an accuracy of 84%) predicts students' exam performance based on several highly correlated features like parental background, course completion, scores in other sections and more. Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using CI code pipeline

Why I Took This Project:
I am curious whether a student's background influences their future performance. If it does, what are the most critical factors? By identifying these, we can be more mindful in supporting students. This project is driven by a desire to understand and address these influences, helping educators optimize their resources for the best student outcomes.
