## End to End Machine Learning Project - Regression

Description: An end-to-end regression solution implemented using a modular programming approach. The model (with an accuracy of 84%) predicts students' exam performance based on several highly correlated features like parental background, course completion, scores in other sections and more. Deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using CI code pipeline

UPDATE: AWS CI-CD Production Grade Deployment using Dockers

## Docker Setup In EC2 commands to be Executed
#optinal

sudo apt-get update -y

sudo apt-get upgrade

#required

curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh

sudo sh get-docker.sh

sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu

newgrp docker

## Configure EC2 as self-hosted runner:

GitHub -> Settings -> Actions -> Runners -> New -> Linux -> Execute the commands in EC2 instance -> Press Enter to skip
NOTE:   Enter the name of runner: [press Enter for IP...] :self-hosted
Skip rest by pressing Enter
(Runner - Whenever code commit - acts as a trigger - CI CD deploy)

./run.sh  ---> Listening for Jobs ==> Any push that happens in repository

## Setup github secrets:
